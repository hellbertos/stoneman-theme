#Stoneman Wordpress Theme

## An new theme for the Stoneman micro-agency built using JS build tools!!

Excited to develop begin using JS build tools in Wordpress theme development! This is, initially, an exercise in how to incorporate NodeJS based build tools into my WP theme development. If all goes well, it will be the new look to the production site.

Also, based on the great tutorial from Mr. Chamoff, it will hopefully mark the begining of use git during the theme dev process. Exciting times indeed!
